This Will help to go through Pull Requests with reviewing our standards. 
It will parse the checks that are specifcally "REQUIRED" within our organization and output whether these checks are passing and if not will output which specific test is failing.
It looks for peer reviewers and looks at codeowners list to ensure that step has been completed before requesting codeowners approval to allow Pull Request through.
